### Administrata

Calculators.
: You are expected to supply your own. Graphing calculators are not permissible.
  (Nor are any calculators capable of loading custom software)

Bathroom Breaks.
: Always permissible **except** for tests / quizzes. If there is a potential
  medical issue, please seek disability accomodations.

Disability Accomodations.
: See syllabus. Not all disabilities can be accomodated for. I'll do my best.

Attendance.
: Attend every lecture. Tests will have a "make up" for no shows. Missing a test
  and its make

Important Dates
: Some important dates include 

  | Date       | Event                                     |

### Lecture Notes

Statistics.
: The art of making sense of data. Two main disciplines include **descriptive
  statistics** (summarizing and communicating data) and **inferential 
  statistics** (drawing conclusions from data).

Jobs.
: Researchers. Analysts. Actuaries. 'Data Scientists'. High salaries. $$$.

Software.
: Spreadsheet applications (LO Calc, MS Excel, etc.). Programming languages
  (R, Python). Visualization tools.

Sumation Notation.
: $$\Sigma$$ (greek: capital"sigma") is used to denote sums. Useful notation 
  when sums have an unspecified number of terms.

Sample / Data Set.
: Basically some collection of data that we have access to.

(Sample) Standard Deviation.
: Measure of dispersion. Shares the same unit (if any) of the underlying sample.
  Not robust. Denoted by $$\sigma$$ (lowercase "sigma"). Defined by

  $$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum (x-\bar{x})^2}.$$

  The summation is over every value $$x$$ in the sample (mean = $$\bar x$$).
  $$N$$ is the sample size.

  **NOTE:** Some statisticians choose to use $$N$$ in the denominator instead of
  $$N-1$$. Search 'bias-variance tradeoff' for the pros/cons.

(Sample) Variance.
: A measure of dispersion. The square of the sample variance. Measured in the
  square of the unit (if any) of the underlying sample data. Denoted by
  $$\sigma^2$$:

  $$\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{N-1} \sum (x - \bar x)^2.$$

### Code


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~python
def dot(vec1, vec2):
    total = 0
    for comp1, comp2 in zip(vec1, vec2):
        total += comp1 * comp2
    return 0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here, the vector `vec1` must contain numerical instances.
