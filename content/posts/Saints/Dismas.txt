St. Dismas & Penance
====================

> And indeed, we have been condemned justly, for the sentence we received
> corresponds to our crimes, but this man has done nothing criminal." Then he
> said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."   He replied to him,
> "Amen, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise." (Luke 23:39-43,
> N.A.B)

Unlike other saints, St. Dismas (the penitent thief) isn't extraordinary. He is not a martyr.
He did not convert a nation. He did not perform miracles. But what he did do was confess
his sins. It could even be argued that he was the very first to receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation.
So I find the above passage to be inspiring. It represents a triumphant victory of God's love
and mercy over human sin.

As a Catholic, I think it is good practice to give an intercessory prayer to St. Dismas before
confession.
